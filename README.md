The goal of the final project is to give you the chance to create something unique using HTML code. While there is a lot of freedom in what you create, there are a few hard requirements. In general you must write code that will pass validation and accessibility checkers. The code must include elements for a doctype, head, body, title, and main. In the main I expect to see at a minimum headings, images, and a list. When you complete your site you must host it and share it with your peers for review.

Your peer review is a learning experience as well since it will allow you to run validators on code that you have not written. It will also give you the opportunity to review HTML syntax.

Your project will be graded by the careful examination of your code by a peer as well as the  
The W3C Markup Validation Service Tool
 and the 
WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool
.  Your peers will look for the specific tags required in the assignment and the tools will check that your code uses the tags correctly

 Create a fully formed page with a doctype, head element, and body element

Use three semantic tags, including h1 and main.

Include a list with at least three items

Include at least three images

Include at least one link to an external source

Validate your site

Host and share your site

Peer review 3 other sites

Issues you detected in the code review:

"The link you submitted does not link to a valid site.  Please check the URL."

"Your site only has two semantic tags, an <h1> and a <main>.  You need to add one more."

"The link to one of your images is broken."

"You have alt attributes on your images but some of them are not descriptive.  Make sure to use descriptive text instead of empty quotes “”.  "

"The alt attribute  on your second image just says “photo”.  Use something more descriptive."  

Issues you detected using a validator:

"W3 validator detected that your site is missing the title element.  Add it to the head section."

"Both validators detected that your third image is missing the alt attribute."

"Wave detected that you used an <h1> element and then an <h3> element.  You can’t skip over heading levels."

Example 1 - Michigan Facts

Example 2 - Movies

Example 3 - Comparing Laptops

Are we grading on the attractiveness of a site?

No, we are only evaluating the HTML code.  But feel free to let someone know if you think that they did a particularly good job with their page layout.

When peer grading how can I see the code?

Click on the link that they provide.  If you get a 404 error then they will need to submit a new valid link.  If you see the page (but not the code) you can do a Right Click on the page and then View Page Source.

Are warnings allowed in the validators?

Do not deduct for validator warnings, just for errors.
